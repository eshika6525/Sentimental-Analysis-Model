# Sentiment Analysis on Restaurant Reviews 🍽️🧠

This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** to perform sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews. It classifies feedback as **positive** or **negative**, helping businesses better understand customer opinions and improve service quality.

## 💡 Objective
To build a machine learning model that can predict the sentiment of customer reviews using text classification techniques. The aim is to assist businesses in analyzing customer feedback effectively.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Training Data:** 1,000 labeled restaurant reviews (`HistoricDump.tsv`)
- **Testing Data:** 1,000 fresh reviews (`FreshDump.tsv`)
- Each review is labeled as either **positive (1)** or **negative (0)**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- NLTK (for text preprocessing)  
- Scikit-learn (for model building & evaluation)  
- Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

## ✅ Features
- Text preprocessing: Cleaning, stemming, stopword removal  
- Vectorization using Bag-of-Words  
- Sentiment prediction on fresh/unseen reviews  
- Confusion matrix and accuracy/F1-score visualizations  

## 🌟 Impact
Helps restaurants and service-based businesses:
- Monitor customer satisfaction  
- Make data-driven decisions  
- Improve service based on direct feedback
